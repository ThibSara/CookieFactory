1. Problem Description and Challenges:

Problem Description:
The problem revolves around efficiently utilizing a roll of dough to produce biscuits of different sizes and shapes. The roll has defects at certain positions, categorized into classes. Each biscuit has a size, value, and a maximum threshold for each defect class. The goal is to maximize the total value of biscuits while adhering to certain constraints.

Challenges:

    - Optimization Challenge: Maximizing the total value while considering defect thresholds and roll length.
    - Constraint Satisfaction Challenge: Ensuring that each biscuit placement satisfies the size and defect constraints.
    - Algorithmic Challenge: Designing an efficient algorithm for biscuit placement to handle the large search space.

2. Formulate and Implement the Problem Using Python:

Steps Taken:

    Data Loading: Load defect information from 'defects.csv'.
    Define Biscuit Properties: Create a class for biscuits with attributes such as size, value, and defect thresholds.
    Formulate Constraints: Implement functions to check constraints (integer positions, no overlap, defect thresholds, roll length).
    Search Algorithm: Implement an algorithm to search for optimal biscuit placements, considering constraints.

Motivations:

    Modularity: Designing classes for biscuits and functions for constraints enhances code modularity.
    Readability: Clearly defining constraints and algorithmic steps improves code readability.

3. Propose Two Alternative Problem-Solving Approaches:

Approach 1: Genetic Algorithm (GA)

    Justification: GA can explore the search space efficiently and handle the complexity of the optimization problem.
    Implementation: Use genetic operators (crossover, mutation) to evolve biscuit placements.

Approach 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

    Justification: The problem has well-defined constraints, making it suitable for CSP.
    Implementation: Use backtracking with constraint propagation to find valid biscuit placements.

Comparison:

    Performance: Evaluate execution time and solution quality for both approaches.
    Robustness: Assess how each approach handles variations in defect positions and biscuit properties.

4. Conclusion and Reflections:
